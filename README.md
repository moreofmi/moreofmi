- 👋 Hi, My name is Moremi.
- 👀 I am an epidemiologist by training and work experience, but I am interested in increasing my data science skills and branching more into that world.
- 🌱 I am proficient in SAS, R, and Tableau. I am currently learning Python, SQL, and Machine Learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me put into use the skills I'm learning. I truly enjoy coding and data science, so I'm excited about this adventure. 
- 📫 You can reach me at moreofmi@yahoo.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I recently got into playing pickleball, and I can say that I'm obsessed. I've been frequently playing and watching YouTube videos to improve. It's exciting.
